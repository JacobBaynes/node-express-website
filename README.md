# Building a website with Node.js and Express

This repository contains the code for Daniel Khan's course 'Building a Website with Node.js and Express.js' on [LinkedIn Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/building-a-website-with-node-js-and-express-js-3).

I followed the course to learn Node.js Express.JS and it is part of a LinkedIn MEAN stack learning path.  I am also using this and other projects to better understand how to use Git version control.
